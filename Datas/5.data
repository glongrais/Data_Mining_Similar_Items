 The Eee Super Hybrid Engine utility lets users overclock or underclock their Eee PC's to boost performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements .
 A few other things I'd like to point out is that you must push the micro, sized right angle end of the ac adapter until it snaps in place or the battery may not charge .
 In addition the ac adapter does get quite hot while it is actively charging the battery, which Asus clearly mentions in the user manual, so one should not be alarmed over the heat output .

 I fit in the Coupe comfortably .
 The driver seating is uncomfortable .
 It's a comfortable ride and is very high quality .
 After you add sales tax, you are then approaching the price of the V series which gets twice the battery life .
 Battery life is one of the biggest features of a netbook so I wouldn't go cheap and get less battery .
Deciding between the V series and the P series really comes done to how much you care about a slight speed different  , a small battery life difference, a better web cam, Bluetooth, and or the netbook sleeve .
,  The best thing about this unit is the battery life .
,  The long life battery makes this unit heavy .
Since the battery life difference is minimum, the only reason to upgrade would be to get the better keyboard .
 For $30, $40 more you get one less usb port, you get covered usb ports which is annoying, and you get less than half the battery life .
 It has the longest battery life of any notebook .
While my 1005HA works like a charm, I personally know several folks that have experienced issues with the battery and or power supply .
Eventually, I noticed that most of these critical reviews referred to the battery or to the charging brick and most of those were describing what could have easily been mistakes made by the owners of the machine .
 They didn't attach the power cord properly or the charging time was too short and some didn't seem to understand how to determine when the battery was fully charged .
 Some complainers faulted the battery life, but didn't take into account what was running or turned on when using the computer .
 The battery is drained more quickly when the computer is operating with all rockets running .
 I suppose that is one reason why I kept gravitating to the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU as I explored the reviews for other brands, , in spite of the warnings about unworkable battery chargers and inoperative batteries I bought the Asus Eee PC .
 The main difference is probably the ten hour battery that is unique and ships with the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU .
 I wanted the netbook to use on long airplane flights so the long life battery was a real plus for me .
 The Asus Eee PC is sleek and that big battery doesn't stick out on the back edge like the other netbook high capacity batteries do .
 I like it a lot  the battery and charger problems I feared so much have not materialized .
 I am still a little worried about that battery thing .

 Drivers seat not comfortable, the car itself compared to other models of similar class .
 It's very comfortable, remarkably large inside and just an overall great vehicle .
 Front seats are very uncomfortable .
 I'm 6' tall, and find the driving position pretty comfortable .
 However, there are a couple of things that kill it for me 1 terrible driver seat comfort, kills my back 2 lack luster interior design, my Acadia has much better comfort 3 the VCM drives me crazy because the constant change in cylinder use is perceptible enough to be an annoyance .
 The seats are extremely uncomfortable .
 While the Accord is no Acura it is a close relative in terms of quality and comfort .
 I previously owned a 98 Avalon, and found the seats more comfortable than the Honda .
 I'm very sad ,  I loved my daughter's Civic and the dealer service is fantastic, but even good service can't help the uncomfortable seats .
 Overall performance is good but comfort level is poor .
 short battery life  I moved up from an 8gb .
I love this ipod except for the battery life .
 long battery  scratch resistant
 Battery drains even if I don't use it .
 I only wonder why the battery seems to drain when I'm not using it, even after sliding the top control button to off when shutting down .
 great in the car, light, portable, good quality, long battery,scratch resistant .
5G lies a more mature iPod, many steps wiser and more able than its one, year, old  The iPod gains many incremental improvements, including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing price points of $249 for the 30GB version and $349 for the huge 80GB version   .
5GB and the better battery life rated for up to 6 .
 battery, not dummie proof  I love the color of this iPod .
 Battery life isn't amazing, Definitely need to get a case for it  I wanted to get a new iPod because I was upgrading from the mini .
 The battery doesn't last a long time especially when you're recording or watching a video but I just listen to music most of the time and it lasts me a good length of time doing that .
 doesn't take pictures, battery life  It's my first ipod, but it's amazing .
 Also, the battery life wasn't that long enough for me, but i'm new to this so it just might me be .
 When you use the radio it uses a lot of battery life  i got this exact iPod for christmas .
 good quality  light  long battery  portable  scratch resistant
 scratches easily, short battery life  I purchased this for my 6 year old son and he LOVES IT !
 Price battery replacement  The iPod basically does what Apple says it does .
 I do not like it that I will have to get Apple to eventually replace the battery .
 I think Apple's idea is that instead of replacing the battery, you will exchange it for a newer iPod .
 Make it inconvenient to replace the battery  make it convenient to replace the iPod .
 The Pedometer feature seems accurate, but a battery waster .
 The ride is a great balance between handling and comfort .
 Although it is fun to drive and quality seems ok, the leather seats are very uncomfortable, especially on a long drive .
Although not the fastest, most luxurious, or technologically advanced in the very competitive mid, size sedan segment, the Accord strikes the perfect balance of sport, comfort and value, creating a vehicle that feels and acts like a much pricier machine .

 What a car, design, ride, comfort, 270 watt audio system, I love this car .
 The seats are very comfortable & supportive .
I like my Accord very much, but had I known the drivers seat was so uncomfortable I would have never bought it .
 Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .
 This Accord is the only large car I found with upscale comfort amenities and a good manual transmission .
 Comfort inside is better than expected .
 My family of 5 can comfortably ride in this car .
 This car is a dream from the GAS to the STYLE to the COMFORT .
 Its the most comfortable Accord I have had .
 I do find the lumbar on the driver's seat a bit uncomfortable though .
 The car is very comfortable, the steering is tight and precise .

 Rides with comfort and motor will pick up if you need it .
 It gives a sporty driving feel and offers a very comfortable Highway ride .
 Uncomfortable in Camry, Had a Nissan before, rough ride .
 Test drove Honda and enjoyed the firm yet very comfortable ride .
 It's very comfortable, has pretty much every luxury feature you might want, and is still fun to drive .
 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .
 Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !
 My only complaint is comfort .
 The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .
 However, the 08 Accord is well designed, handles well for its size and the comfort level is so much better than the TL .
 Absolutely got a great car, roomy, comfortable, great ride for a nice price .
 Fun to drive, safe, reliable, and comfortable .
 Driver's seat is not fully adjustable using 8, way power seat which is very uncomfortable .
 The car is solid, beautiful, comfortable, fuel efficient and big enough for my family of 5   .
 Everyone loves the way it rides and we took it to the lake   without a single complaint of comfort .
 Driving 55 miles per hr between Houston and Austin this slow is very painful, boring to drv,Our Avalanche averaged 15 city with a very comfortable seat and only 20 highway but the vast majority of our driving is in the city not a good trade off .
 At 6'5 it is very comfortable .
 Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .
 However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .
 The seat contour creates uncomfortable pressure points which quickly become tiring and downright painful .
 The Camry was very comfortable, but not sporty and the ride was boring .
The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .
I always dreamed of a PC that has very long battery life
 Has three USB ports on the sides and the back area houses the six cell battery   .
Factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .
 Regarding battery duration I cannot comment on its purpose since whenever I am doing word processing tasks, have always music or videos running .
 And using the two USB port external ASUS disk drive, battery life decreases to only two hours .
 It's battery life and ease of replacement is key .
 I have the $299 version from Best Buy, it has a 3 cell battery with 3hrs of battery operation .
 A 6 cell battery costs over $79 dollars .
 I was skeptical about the long battery life and the cool, touch but I got about 9 .
5hr battery model is going to run a touch heavier than the 6 .
5hr battery models but the extra battery life is really worth it .
 It does not overheat and the battery lasts a long time, not 10 .
 Using a USB mouse lessens the battery time but I LOVE it anyway, it fits into my purse, the colors are great and it is much quicker than my desk top .
The computer will rarely turn on even though the battery has plenty of charge in it .
 The battery life is to die for ,  my full size laptop doesnt have 10
I'm actually downgrading in performance in getting this netbook but the performance lost is made up with the smaller form factor and greatly increased battery life .

 First is the incredible battery life .
 I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .
 Has a very long battery life, runs videos and multimedia smoothly without issues, fast loading, very usable keyboard, stylish sleek design, decent pricing for what you get
The ~10 hour battery life is great .
 Since I have bluetooth and wi, fi on most of the time I actually get about 6~7 hours of battery life .
 The battery power is long lasting, and it serves me well throughout the day .
 1 light weight, 2 long battery life, and 3 reasonable performance .
 Although 1008HA is lighter and thinner, I felt that 1005HA is a better choice for me because of its removable, long battery life and easy RAM access .
 When you start it up for the first time, leave it plugged in ONLY as long as it takes for the battery to charge to full .
 At this point, it is normal for the adapter to become very, very hot while charging all the way from low battery .
If you follow these instructions for several battery cycles, you should find that the charger eventually stops overheating .
And over 9 hours of battery life !
 It has the best battery life out of all the netbooks currently available .
 You have to physically shut, down, unplug, plus remove the battery ,  then restart .
If the ratio of battery, life to cost is important to you ,  this is a decent netbook, except for the inevitable charger failure .
Battery life advertised at 10 .
5 Hour Battery Life to anyone who was looking to make a netbook purchase  Asus seems to have gotten a poor reputation based on their customer service and the faulty power cords they've been sending out, but the netbook itself is a gem .
I love this netbook so far I have not been able to run out of battery 10 .
5 hour battery life is not true ,  if your doing anything other then nothing you will usualy get like 6, 7 hour battery
 Battery performance couldn't be more nice, as well as performance .
 It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .
 Unboxed the netbook, put in the battery, charged it up, everything was great .
 The battery life lasted me about a good 6, 7 hours of e, mail, internet, some MS office work, and watched a video or 2 from streaming Netflix .
Only problem was when I went to recharge my battery for the SECOND TIME EVER OWNING THIS NETBOOK, the power adapter wasn't working .
I bought this netbook and the AC adapter worked fine, but the battery wouldn't charge at all .
 So I exchanged the bad netbook for a new one, but the new one is just like the first  the battery will not charge at all .
 I read the reviews before I first bought this netbook and was aware that there was an issue with the battery .
 Extra long battery life ,  pretty accurate specs given
5 Hour Battery Life was the one that caught my eye .
 Obviously ,  the battery drained out within hours .
 Battery life is longer than I had expected obviously 10 .
 And even better, has a built in webcam, an impeccable battery life, a great touch pad and exceptionally ergonomic design .
 Battery life around 6 hours playing games or DVIX videos which in my book is simply awesome !
 Love the LED backlight concept which saves battery life and you don't have to worry about the flourescent bulbs fading after a few years   .
 Now I keep battery topped off or charge when not in use and no longer seems to be a problem .
This netbook has plenty of power for my needs and the battery life is great .
Been very pleased with performance and battery life, however power supply went out after 60 days .
0 out of 5 stars Initially battery problems , ,  however now it works, December 22, 2009
In the mean time I let the battery go down completely  turned out the battery would not charge, even though Windows XP was reporting it was .
when experiencing charging problems, let the battery go out completely .
 Noticed that the battery indicator started flashing orange, instead a steady orange .
After 3 hrs the battery was fully charged, unplugged the netbook, started up Windows, and the battery indicator showed about 10 hours charge remaining .
The battery life is pretty good though the trackpad is annoying .
what i loved is the battery  :
 The battery's longevity is amazing I get around 
 it is designed to be as small as possible, and the long, life battery on the back end makes it tipsy .
 Excellent battery life, small and light enough to drop in a handbag and forget it's there .
 I tug it around for all my personal stuff and it is light, easy to carry   and I really do get 10 hours plus use of the battery .
The battery on my netbook lasts almost 13 hours since I keep the LCD brightness relatively low .
 It has the fastest processor currently available  , huge battery, life 10 .
I bought this although I already have a Sony Vaio for its light weight and long battery life .
 Indeed it runs as fast as advertised and battery life is excellent .
The most impressive on this is the battery life :
The battery life is incredible .
 I spent a bit of time researching the various netbooks currently available and thought that the 1005HA, P had a nice mix of style, battery life, ergonomics, and performance   .
 I have found the actual battery life to be around 8 hours   .
 The main selling point for this netbook is its amazing battery life .
 The battery doesn't add much bulk to the overall unit at all either .
For this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .
 I haven't put it to the test on how long it actually lasts, but I use it off and on all day and I've never had the battery go dead on me .
The long battery life is on and off .
 Sometimes it says that I have 70% battery life AND 3hrs :
 Saying that, I don't have any battery saving settings set as I'm not too familiar with that and haven't had the need .
 The sound wasn't all that great but hooking up some battery op speakers or headphones would be the way to go there .
 The battery life last almost 4 hours with contine use but I have the battery charger that charges in no time .
 I can easily get 8 hours on the battery life while running multiple programs and listening to music over the wireless internet .
 I have not tried running the battery out quickly or seeing if I can shut things down to get the full 10 .
 The image is nice and crisp and the longevity of the battery is a definite plus .
The battery life has been amazing so far .
 Very lightweight and portable and the battery life is outstanding .
 I took this on a trip and the battery lasted about 6 hours   before showing it was at 53% .
 The computer is quite fast and the battery is amazing .
 Much to my surprise I was shocked at how well it performed, especially the battery .
5 hour battery life is really helpful .
5 hour battery life is great .
 It looks good, is very sleek and stylish, very light and gives around 9, 10 hrs battery backup on 1 charge .
 I am very pleased and would recommend it anyone that wants something very portable with great battery life .
Battery life is great and it seems to charge fast as well .
 On top of that, ASUS tech support reports that the brick is out of stock and will not be available for 2 weeks and my battery is completely dead .
 As a backup I purchased a second battery .
 Key features in my decision were b,g, & n wireless, built in bluetooth mouse capability, and the best in class battery life .
 I bought this to take notes in college classes, so battery life was very important to me and it did not disappoint .
 With the very first charge, I got nearly 10 hours of battery life .
 The battery life is not its promised 10 .
0 out of 5 stars Good ergonomics, exceptional battery, performance meets expectations .
 Pretty standard list of specs for a netbook with the addition of bluetooth and a very long battery life .
 The long battery life is awesome !
 The battery is INFINITELY better, and I can easily squeeze 10 hours out of it if I need to .
 When I learned about the battery life, the memory, hard drive, processor, etc .
